To fix this, add `estimatedItemSize` prop to your FlatList component. This gives the FlatList an estimate of each item's height, improving rendering performance and preventing blank spaces.  For better performance with known height, also use `getItemLayout` prop. 
```javascript
<FlatList
  data={data}
  renderItem={renderItem}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  estimatedItemSize={50} // Estimate of average item height
  getItemLayout={(data, index) => ({
    length: 50, // Fixed height if known
    offset: 50 * index,
    index,
  })}
/>
```
If item height is truly dynamic and unknown, you might need to explore other solutions like using libraries designed for dynamic list rendering, or a combination of techniques to optimize performance and improve accuracy.
